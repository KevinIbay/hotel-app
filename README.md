An application that allows users to book hotel rooms and check in guests to their rooms.

- Web Portal Features (customer view)
  - Search available rooms
  - Book rooms
 
- WPF Core Desktop App (hotel receptionist view)
  - Search by guest's last name with today's date
    - Display list of matching reservations
    - Check in guests

The user has the option to switch between a SQL or SQLite database by configuring the appsettings.json file.

This application is an MVP but it demonstrates my knowledge in the following:
- C#
- SQL, SQLite
- API Design
- Application Design
  - Separation of data and UI layer
