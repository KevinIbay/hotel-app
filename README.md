### An application that allows users to book hotel rooms and check in guests to their rooms.

- Web Portal Features (customer view)

  - Search available rooms
  - Book rooms

- WPF Core Desktop App (hotel receptionist view)
  - Search by guest's last name with today's date
    - Display list of matching reservations
    - Check in guests

The user has the option to switch between a SQL or SQLite database by configuring the appsettings.json file.

### This application is an MVP but it demonstrates my knowledge in the following:

- C#
- .NET Core, Razor Pages, Dapper
- SQL, SQLite
- API Design
- Application Design
  - Separation of data and UI layer
- Dependency Injection

### Possible features to add in future:

- Authentication to allow guests to check in themselves
- Guest history
- Multiple hotel capabilities
- Allow guests to check out
- Allow booking search by number or other piece of information
